var intro = "<p>On returning home from hunting all day, you discover your home on fire, your parents dead in the snow, and your sister is missing.  Goblin tracks cover the ground disappering to the South."

intro += "<p>You have two rabbits, a loaf of bread, one skin of water, a hunting knife, and your short bow, with a dozen good arrows.  You could pursue them right away while you have the best chance of following their trail, but you only have enough food for a few days." 

intro += "<p>The prudent measure would be to go North to Kingsport where you could alert the Kings Guard, get news, and purhcase more supplies.  You know they are probably taking her to Blacktooth Mountain hundreds of leagues to the Southeast, but you will lose 3 days going out of your way."

intro += "<p>First you must bury your parents.  The ground is too frozen to dig, but you manage to gather enough rocks to bury them together in a cairn."

var question = "<p>The time has come to decide, what path will you take?"
